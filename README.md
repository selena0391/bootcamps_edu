# Bootcamps Data
This is a project to gather, transform, and analize data from technology bootcamps and their outcomes.
## Motivation
As part of the Data Science track from **The Knowledge House**, we have created this capstone project, to put into practice the knowledge we have acquired,
such as Python programming, libraries to process data, to analize data, and to present information as plots, charts, etc. As well as to interpret the data
and generate conclusions based on the described process.

The libraries we have used are the following:

Library | Description 
| :--- | ---: 
os  |  Provides functions for accesing (read, create, remove) files from the operating system. 
csv  |  Allows to access csv files. 
re  |  For using regular expressions.
PyPDF2  | Provides functions for working with PDF documents (create, read, edit).
tabula  | Provides functions for working with PDF documents (create, read, edit).
pandas  | Used for working with data sets. It has functions for analyzing, cleaning, exploring, and manipulating data.
numpy  | Describe it.
matplotlib  | Describe it.
psycopg2  | The PostgreSQL database adapter for the Python programming language.
seaborn  | Based on matplotlib. It provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics.
scipy  | Contains modules for optimization, linear algebra, integration, interpolation, special functions, signal and image processing.
statsmodels  | Module that provides classes and functions for the estimation of many different statistical models, as well as for conducting statistical tests, and statistical data exploration.
sklearn  | It features various classification, regression and clustering algorithms.
sklearn.impute import SimpleImputer  | .
sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression  | .
sklearn.linear_model import Lasso  | .
sklearn.linear_model import Ridge  | .
sklearn.linear_model import ElasticNet  | .
sklearn.metrics import r2_score, mean_squared_error  | .

The process we followed in this project includes the following steps:
* Process the data from the PDF files to populate a CSV file containing information from the PDF files
* Create a Exploratory Data Analysis -EDA-, using the CSV file 
* Desing and create a database to load the data contained in the CSV file
* Create a process to load the data from the CSV file, to the corresponding tables in the database
* Create the eda process.
* Create the cda process.
* Create plots and dashboard using Tableau Public version.
* Create the final presentation.
